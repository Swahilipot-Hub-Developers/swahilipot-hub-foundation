            <p>
              Why are all technology, innovation, and incubation hubs based in
              Nairobi? Nairobi is not Kenya and Kenya is not Nairobi. Something
              has to change. Aha moment that inspired the founding of
              Swahilipot.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2016, Mahmoud Noor (alias Mentor001) took action and founded
              Swahilipot with support from National Museums of Kenya (NMK),
              Seacom, ICT Authority, and Cisco.
            </p>
            <p>
              Swahilipot started as a community-based organization (CBO) with
              programs focused on technology & innovation. Has grown over the
              years to become a non-profit organization (NGO) with diverse
              program areas and reach.

              to a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) regulated by the The

              first edition of Pwani Innovation Week, its first major activity
              focused on promoting technology and innovation in the Coastal
              region of Kenya. On the last day of PIW, Swahilipot hosts Pwani

              <span className='fw-bold'>2021:</span> Swahilipot Hub Foundation
              becomes the anchor partner for the Global Opportunity Youth
              Network (GOYN) in Mombasa and secures its first grant as an NGO.
              GOYN is a multi-stakeholder initiative that seeks to create
              place-based systemic shifts for youth economic opportunity. GOYN
              is based at the Aspen Institutes Forum for Community Solutions.
              Opportunity Youth are young people aged 18 - 35 who are out of
              school, unemployed, not in education or training. With this kind
              of support, it starts to transition from an organization that is
              volunteer-led and run to hiring full-time staff on payroll.
